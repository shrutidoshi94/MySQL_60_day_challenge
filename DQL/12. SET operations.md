## 12.	Set operations (combine multiple SELECTs)

 | Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `UNION` | Combines results, removes duplicates |
| `UNION ALL` | Combines results with duplicates |
| `INTERSECT`* | Common results (Not supported directly in MySQL but can be mimicked) |
| `EXCEPT`* | Differences (also not directly supported) |

**12.1 UNION / UNION ALL - Merge Rows**



```sql
-- UNION removes duplicates
SELECT 
	first_name 
FROM employees_us
UNION
SELECT 
	first_name 
FROM employees_uk;
```

```sql
-- UNION ALL retains duplicates
SELECT 
	first_name 
FROM employees_us AS emp_us
LEFT JOIN salary
ON emp_us.id = salary.id
WHERE salary.amount IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 
	first_name 
FROM employees_uk;
```

**Rules:**
1. SET Operator can be used almost in all clauses - WHERE | JOIN | GROUP BY | HAVING
2. ORDER BY is allowed only once at the end of query
3. The number of columns in each query must be the same
4. Data types of columns in each query must be compatible
5. The order of the columns in each query must be the same
6. The column names in the result set are determined by the column names specified in the first query.
7. Even if all rules are met and SQL shows no errors, the result may be incorrect. Incorrect column selection leads to inaccurate


**ℹ️ Note: INTERSECT and EXCEPT are not supported in MySQL directly but can be emulated using JOIN and NOT EXISTS**

**INTERSECT
SQL Server (direct way):**

```sql
SELECT column 
FROM table1

INTERSECT

SELECT column 
FROM table2;
```

**MySQL (using INNER JOIN):**

```sql
SELECT column 
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**MySQL (using IN):**

```sql
SELECT column 
FROM table1
WHERE column IN 
(SELECT column FROM table2);
```

**EXCEPT
SQL Server (direct way):**

```sql
SELECT column 
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column 
FROM table2;
```

**MySQL (using LEFT JOIN + IS NULL):**

```sql
SELECT t1.column
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 
ON t1.column = t2.column
WHERE t2.column IS NULL;
```

**MySQL (using NOT IN):**

```sql
SELECT column 
FROM table1
WHERE column NOT IN 
(SELECT column FROM table2);
```

**MySQL (using NOT EXISTS):**

```sql
SELECT column
FROM table1 t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
(
    SELECT 1 
    FROM table2 t2 
    WHERE t1.column = t2.column
);
```
