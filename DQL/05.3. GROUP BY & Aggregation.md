# GROUP BY

When you need to **summarize** large datasets—for example, calculating totals, averages, or counts—MySQL’s aggregate functions together with the `GROUP BY` clause let you collapse many rows into meaningful summaries (e.g., “total sales by product”, “user counts per country”, etc.).

**GROUP BY single column -**

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

GROUP BY groups rows that have **the same values in specified columns**.

**GROUP BY multiple columns -**
SQL forms groups based on the **unique combinations** of values in those columns.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, AGG_FUNC(col3)
FROM table
GROUP BY col1, col2;
```

Group rows by **each distinct combination of col1 and col2**, then apply the aggregate function on the grouped data.

## HAVING - Filter After Grouping

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

**🔴 Invalid Use (This will cause an error):**

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	SUM(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE SUM(salary) > 50000  -- ❌ Not allowed
GROUP BY department;
```

**✅ Correct Use with HAVING:**

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
```


| **Clause** | **Purpose**                         | **Can I Use Aggregates?** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| WHERE      | Filters rows**before** grouping     | ❌ No                     |
| HAVING     | Filters groups**after** aggregation | ✅ Yes                    |

### Why HAVING is used with GROUP BY

**Because aggregate functions are not available before grouping**

- The WHERE clause is evaluated **before** the data is grouped using GROUP BY.
- At that point, **aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() are not yet computed**.
- Therefore, you **cannot** filter based on aggregate values in the WHERE clause.

**HAVING is evaluated after GROUP BY**

- Once the groups are created using GROUP BY, **aggregate functions are computed per group**.
- Then the HAVING clause is evaluated to **filter these groups** based on aggregate results.

**Table: sales**


| **id** | **region** | **product** | **amount** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE amount > 100
GROUP BY region, product
HAVING SUM(amount) > 400;
```

***Note:*** *You can only use aggregated columns with `HAVING`. You cannot use non-aggregated columns within `HAVING` clause.*

## ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY

`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` is a SQL mode in MySQL that enforces stricter rules for `GROUP BY` queries. It is by default in MySQL and dictates that:

1. **All non-aggregated columns in the `SELECT` list must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.**
2. **All non-aggregated columns in the `HAVING` condition or `ORDER BY` list must also be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.**
3. **The only exception** is if a non-aggregated column is *functionally dependent* on a column in the `GROUP BY` clause. This means if column A is in the `GROUP BY`, and column B's value is uniquely determined by column A (e.g., if A is a primary key and B is another column in the same table), then B doesn't strictly need to be in the `GROUP BY`.

```
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This is fine. But if you also tried to select `order_date`:

**SQL**

```
SELECT customer_id, order_date, SUM(total_amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Without `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`, MySQL might just pick *one* `order_date` from each customer's orders (e.g., the first one it encounters) and present it. This `order_date` might not be meaningful in the context of the `SUM(total_amount)` for all orders of that customer.

With `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` enabled, this query would produce an error:
`ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.Orders.order_date' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by`

**How to resolve `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` errors:**

When you encounter this error, you have a few options:

1. **Add the non-aggregated column to the `GROUP BY` clause:**
   If `order_date` is relevant to your grouping, include it:
   **SQL**

   ```
   SELECT customer_id, order_date, SUM(total_amount)
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY customer_id, order_date; -- Now groups by customer and specific order date
   ```

   This would give you the total amount for each customer for each *specific order date* .
2. **Apply an aggregate function to the non-aggregated column:**
   If you want a single `order_date` to represent the group (e.g., the earliest or latest order date for that customer), use an aggregate function:
   **SQL**

   ```
   SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date, SUM(total_amount)
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY customer_id; -- Now correctly aggregates order_date
   ```
3. **Use `ANY_VALUE()` (MySQL 5.7.5+):**
   If you genuinely don't care which value is picked (perhaps because you know all values for that column within a group will be the same, or it's just for debugging), you can explicitly tell MySQL to pick an arbitrary value using `ANY_VALUE()`:
   **SQL**

   ```
   SELECT customer_id, ANY_VALUE(order_date) AS arbitrary_order_date, SUM(total_amount)
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY customer_id;
   ```

   While `ANY_VALUE()` technically works, it's generally discouraged unless you are absolutely certain of its implications for your data. It indicates that you are accepting a non-deterministic result for that specific column.
4. **Disable `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` (Discouraged for new development):**
   You can disable this SQL mode at the session level or globally in your MySQL configuration. However, this is generally **not recommended** for new development as it can lead to the ambiguous results discussed earlier. It's often done for compatibility with older applications that relied on MySQL's previous, more permissive `GROUP BY` behavior.

   * **Temporarily for current session:**
     `SET SESSION sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));`
   * **Globally (requires MySQL restart and editing `my.cnf`):**
     Find the `sql_mode` setting in your `my.cnf` (or `my.ini` on Windows) and remove `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` from the comma-separated list.

In summary, `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` is a vital MySQL mode that promotes writing standard-compliant, unambiguous, and reliable SQL queries by enforcing strict rules on how `GROUP BY` clauses interact with selected columns. It helps prevent subtle data errors that might otherwise go unnoticed.
