**4.1.3. Logical Operators**

Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AND` | True if both are true | `a = 1 AND b = 2` |
| `OR` | True if any is true | `a = 1 OR b = 2` |
| `NOT` | Reverses a condition | `NOT a = 1` |

**4.1.4. Bitwise Operators***

Used for bit-level operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | Bitwise AND | `a & b` |
| `\|`| Bitwise OR  | `a \| b`   |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR | `a ^ b` |
| `~` | Bitwise NOT | `~a` |
| `<<` | Left shift | `a << 1` |
| `>>` | Right shift | `a >> 1` |

**4.1.5. Assignment Operators**

Used to assign values (mostly in stored programs like procedures or variables).

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | Assign value | `SET @a = 5;` |
| `:=` | Assign value | `SELECT @a := 5;` |

### 4.2 Match

**4.2.1 % - Matches Zero or More Characters**
```sql
--- Names that contain 'oh'
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%oh%';
```

**4.2.2 _ - Matches Exactly One Character**
```sql
--- Names with exactly 5 characters
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '_____';  -- 5 underscores
```


**4.2.3 Escape Wildcards When Needed**
<br>If your search includes actual % or _ characters (e.g., emails), use ESCAPE:</br>
```sql
--- Find emails containing a literal '%'
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE message LIKE '%!%%' ESCAPE '!';
```

**4.2.4 Full-Text Search (`MATCH` ... `AGAINST`)**

Full-Text Search (FTS) allows you to perform **searches** on large text data — much more advanced than using LIKE '%word%'.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
WHERE MATCH(column1, column2, ...) 
      AGAINST('search text');
```

**How it Works**

1. **Full-Text Index** must exist on the columns you’re searching.
2. MySQL builds a **special index** of words (tokens) in the column.
3. MATCH ... AGAINST compares search terms against this index.
4. It returns **rows with a relevance score**, optionally ranked by it.

**Modes of Full-Text Search**

MySQL supports three modes:

**- Natural Language Mode (default)**

- Treats the search text like a natural sentence.
- Ranks rows by relevance.

```jsx
SELECT *, MATCH(description) 
        AGAINST('open source search engine') AS score
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(description) 
      AGAINST('open source search engine');
```

**Boolean Mode**

- Enables logical operators like +, -, *, ".

| **Operator** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| + | Word **must be present** |
| - | Word **must not be present** |
| * | Wildcard |
| " | Exact phrase |
| > / < | Increases or decreases relevance weight |

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, body)
      AGAINST('+mysql -oracle' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

**Query Expansion Mode**

- Useful when results are few.
- Adds **similar terms** from top results and reruns the query.

```sql
AGAINST('search terms' WITH QUERY EXPANSION)
```
