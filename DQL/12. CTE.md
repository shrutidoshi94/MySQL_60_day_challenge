# Common Table Expression

- CTE stands for **Common Table Expression**.
- A **temporary named result set** (a virtual table) used within a larger SQL query.
- Helps in **organizing**, **simplifying**, and **modularizing** complex SQL logic.

### CTE vs Subquery


| Feature                  | Subquery                      | CTE                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Structure                | Written**bottom-up**          | Written**top-down**                     |
| Reusability              | Used**once**                  | Can be reused**multiple times**         |
| Scope                    | Local to one clause           | Accessible across the entire main query |
| Modularity & Readability | Less modular                  | Highly modular and readable             |
| Syntax                   | Inline`SELECT` inside clauses | Defined with`WITH` clause               |

***Notes:***

- You cannot use `ORDER BY` directly within CTE. It also cannot be used within views, inline functions, derived tables, and subqueries.

### Syntax of a CTE

```sql
-- CTE definition:
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT ...
)
-- Main Query:
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

## Types of CTEs

### Non-Recursive CTEs

#### A. **Standalone CTE**

- Independent of other CTEs or queries.
- Queries database tables directly.
- Example:

```sql
WITH total_sales AS (
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales.orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM total_sales;
```

#### B. **Multiple Standalone CTEs**

- Define multiple independent CTEs:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (...),
     cte2 AS (...)

SELECT * 
FROM cte1 
JOIN cte2 
ON ...;
```

#### C. **Nested CTE**

- A CTE that uses another CTE inside its definition.
- Enables **stepwise data processing**.

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
 SELECT...
 FROM ...
 WHERE...), 

cte2 AS (
 SELECT
 FROM cte1
 WHERE)

-- main query:
SELECT..
FROM cte 2
WHERE..
```

### Recursive CTEs

- Used for hierarchical data or sequences.
- CTE refers to **itself** inside the definition.
- Combines an **anchor query** with a **recursive query** using `UNION ALL`.

#### Examples:

```sql
-- Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20
WITH RECURSIVE series AS (
  SELECT 1 AS n  -- Anchor
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM series WHERE n < 10  -- Recursive
)
-- Main Query:
SELECT * 
FROM series;
```

```sql
-- Calculate Factorial of numbers from 1 to 5
WITH RECURSIVE factorial_cte AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n, 1 AS fact
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, fact * (n + 1)
    FROM factorial_cte
    WHERE n < 5
)
SELECT * FROM factorial_cte;
```

```sql
/*Employee Hierarchy Traversal
Assume a table employee:
 employee_id INT,
 name VARCHAR(100),
 manager_id INT*/

WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Top-level manager (CEO)

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy h 
	ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
)

SELECT * 
FROM employee_hierarchy 
ORDER BY level;

/*Iteration Flow Summary:
1. Anchor Query finds the CEO(s): manager_id IS NULL
2. Recursive Query:
 • Takes each employee found so far
 • Searches for direct reports (employees whose manager_id = employee_id of current row)
 • Adds these new employees to the result set
3. Repeats step 2 using the newly found employees as input
4. Stops automatically when:
 • No new employees are found (i.e., no rows match the JOIN condition) OR
 • MySQL hits a system-defined recursion limit (default: 1000) OR
 • An explicit stopping condition (e.g., WHERE level <= 5) is met
```

```sql
/*Category Tree (Parent-Child Navigation)
Suppose you have a table categories:
categories (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  parent_id INT
)*/

WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
  -- Anchor: start with root categories
  SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    parent_id,
    0 AS depth
  FROM categories
  WHERE parent_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive: find children of current category
  SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.parent_id,
    t.depth + 1
  FROM categories c
  JOIN category_tree t ON c.parent_id = t.id
)

SELECT * 
FROM category_tree 
ORDER BY depth, name;

/*Execution Flow
1. Step 1: Electronics → depth = 0
2. Step 2: Phones, Laptops → children of Electronics → depth = 1
3. Step 3: Android Phones, iPhones → children of Phones → depth = 2
4. No more children → recursion ends.*/
```

## Benefits

- **Improves Readability**: Break complex queries into manageable parts.
- **Encourages Modularity**: Each CTE handles a separate step/task.
- **Enables Reusability**: CTE results can be referenced multiple times.
- **Optimizes Performance**: Avoids repeated joins/aggregations.
- **Supports Recursion**: Useful for hierarchies, graphs, sequences.

## Best Practices

- Use **3–5 CTEs per query** for maintainability.
- Avoid over-nesting which leads to performance degradation.
- **Merge CTEs** when possible to reduce memory usage.
- Treat CTE results as **virtual, temporary tables**.

## CTE Execution Flow

1. SQL Server/MySQL identifies and executes the **CTE(s)** first.
2. Stores the results in **memory/cache**.
3. Executes the **main query**, retrieving data from:
   - Database tables
   - Intermediate CTE results
