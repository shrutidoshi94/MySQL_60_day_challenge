## 2.	FROM ￼

The `FROM` clause in a Data Query Language (DQL) `SELECT` is where you tell MySQL which 
- table(s) 
- subquery
- view
- function
to read data from—and, if applicable, **which partition(s)** of a partitioned table to scan. 

```sql
SELECT
  <select_expr>         -- 1. Which columns or expressions you want back
FROM
  table_reference       -- 2. What “table” (or view/subquery/join) you’re pulling rows from
  [PARTITION (…)]       -- 3. (Optional) which partitions of a partitioned table to scan
  [AS] alias            -- 4. (Optional) give that table a short name for the rest of the query
[WHERE …]               -- 6. Filter which rows you actually want to see
[GROUP BY …]            -- 7. Aggregate rows into groups (e.g. SUM(), COUNT())
[HAVING …]              -- 8. Filter those groups (only valid if you used GROUP BY)
[ORDER BY …]            -- 9. Sort the final result set
[LIMIT …];              -- 10. Return only the first N rows
```

A table_reference can be:
	•	A base table or view
	•	A derived table (subquery in parentheses)
	•	A system table function (e.g. DUAL)
	•	A join expression 

### 2.1. Partition Selection

If a table was created with partitioning (RANGE, LIST, HASH, KEY), you can restrict your query to one or more partitions:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM orders PARTITION (p2020, p2021) AS o -- Tells the optimizer to scan only those named partitions instead of the entire table.
 WHERE o.amount > 100;
```

**Benefits**
- Partition pruning: dramatically reduces I/O when you know your data layout.
- Targeted ANALYZE/OPTIMIZE: you can run maintenance on a subset.

**Limitations**
- Only works on named partitions; you cannot mix * or wildcards.
- You cannot specify partitions on a derived table or view—only on a real, partitioned table.

## 2.2 JOIN - Refer 03. JOINS.md

## 2.3 Combine partitions and JOINS

```sql
SELECT o.id, c.name
  FROM orders PARTITION (p2020) AS o
  JOIN customers AS c
    ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

## 2.4. Derived Tables & Subqueries
Read from the result of a subquery as if it were a table:

```sql
SELECT t.region, SUM(t.sales) AS total_sales
  FROM (
    SELECT region, amount AS sales
      FROM transactions
     WHERE dt >= '2025-01-01'
  ) AS t
 GROUP BY t.region;
```

Notes:
- The alias (AS t) is mandatory.
- No PARTITION clause is allowed on a derived table.
