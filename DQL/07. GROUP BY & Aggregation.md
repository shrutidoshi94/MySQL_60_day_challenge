GROUP BY

When you need to **summarize** large datasets—for example, calculating totals, averages, or counts—MySQL’s aggregate functions together with the `GROUP BY` clause let you collapse many rows into meaningful summaries (e.g., “total sales by product”, “user counts per country”, etc.).


**GROUP BY single column -** 
```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

GROUP BY groups rows that have **the same values in specified columns**. 

**GROUP BY multiple columns -** 
SQL forms groups based on the **unique combinations** of values in those columns.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, AGG_FUNC(col3)
FROM table
GROUP BY col1, col2;
```

Group rows by **each distinct combination of col1 and col2**, then apply the aggregate function on the grouped data.

## HAVING - Filter After Grouping

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

 **🔴 Invalid Use (This will cause an error):**

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	SUM(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE SUM(salary) > 50000  -- ❌ Not allowed
GROUP BY department;
```

**✅ Correct Use with HAVING:**

```sql
SELECT 
	department, 
	SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
```

| **Clause** | **Purpose** | **Can I Use Aggregates?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WHERE | Filters rows **before** grouping | ❌ No |
| HAVING | Filters groups **after** aggregation | ✅ Yes |

**Why HAVING is used with GROUP BY**

**Because aggregate functions are not available before grouping**

- The WHERE clause is evaluated **before** the data is grouped using GROUP BY.
- At that point, **aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() are not yet computed**.
- Therefore, you **cannot** filter based on aggregate values in the WHERE clause.

**HAVING is evaluated after GROUP BY**

- Once the groups are created using GROUP BY, **aggregate functions are computed per group**.
- Then the HAVING clause is evaluated to **filter these groups** based on aggregate results.

**Table: sales**

| **id** | **region** | **product** | **amount** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE amount > 100
GROUP BY region, product
HAVING SUM(amount) > 400;
```
