# Subquery

- A subquery is a query nested inside another query (e.g., inside SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN).
- Also known as:

  - Inner query (subquery)
  - Outer query (main query)

- Subqueries are executed first; their result is used by the main query.
- Results are not accessible globally---only the enclosing query can reference them.

**Why Use Subqueries?**

- Decompose complex queries into logical steps.
- Improve readability and maintainability.
- Solve multi-step logic like:
- Filtering after joining
- Aggregating after transformation
- Ranking, conditional filtering, dynamic comparisons

# Types of Subqueries

## A. By Dependency

| Type           | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-Correlated | Independent of outer query; executes once             |
| Correlated     | Depends on outer query's row values; executes per row |

## B. By Return Type

| Type   | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Scalar | 1 row, 1 column (e.g., SELECT AVG(salary) ) |
| Row    | Multiple rows, 1 column                     |
| Table  | Multiple rows, multiple columns             |

## C. By Placement in Query

- `SELECT` clause (only allows scalar subqueries)
- `FROM` clause (used as inline views/derived tables)
- `JOIN` clause (subquery as one side of the join)
- `WHERE` clause (used with comparison/logical operators)

### **In the `FROM` Clause**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT product_id, price, AVG(price) OVER () AS avg_price
  FROM products) AS t
WHERE price > avg_price;
```

- Must alias the subquery (AS t is mandatory).
- Useful for breaking steps into derived tables.

### **In the `SELECT` Clause (Scalar Only)**

```sql
SELECT 
  product_id,
  name,
  price,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders) AS total_orders
FROM products;
```

- Use when you need an aggregated/global value next to each row.
- Only scalar subqueries are valid here.

### **In `JOIN` Clauses**

```sql
SELECT c.*, o.total_orders
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id) AS o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

- Great for summarizing one side before joining.

### **In the `WHERE` Clause -- Scalar Comparison**

```sql
SELECT product_id, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (
 SELECT AVG(price)
 FROM products);
```

- Subquery must return a single value.

### **In the `WHERE` Clause -- Logical Operators**

**A. `IN`/ `NOT IN` (Row Subquery)**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
 SELECT customer_id
 FROM customers
 WHERE country = 'Germany');
```

**B. `ANY` and `ALL`**

```sql
-- ANY: Greater than at least one value
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (
 SELECT salary
 FROM employees
 WHERE gender = 'Male');

-- ALL: Greater than every value
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (
 SELECT salary
 FROM employees
 WHERE gender = 'Male');
```

**C. `EXISTS` / `NOT EXISTS` (Correlated)**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders o
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM customers c
  WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  AND c.country = 'Germany');
```

## Correlated and Non-Correlated Subqueries

Subqueries can be classified based on their dependency on the outer query:

| Type           | Dependency                         | Execution Pattern           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Non-Correlated | Independent of outer query         | Executed once               |
| Correlated     | Depends on values from outer query | Executed once per outer row |

### Non-Correlated Subqueries

A non-correlated subquery is a query that does not reference columns from the outer query. It runs once and returns a result used by the outer query.

**Example:**

Find products that have a price higher than the average price of all products.

```sql
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (
 SELECT AVG(price)
 FROM products);
```

- The subquery `SELECT AVG(price) FROM products` is executed once
- Its result (e.g., 20.00) is used by the outer query to filter rows

### Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery is a query that references columns from the outer query. It runs once for every row processed by the outer query.

**Example**

Show customers and their total number of orders.

```sql
SELECT 
 customer_id,
 name,
 ( SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM orders o
 WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c;
```

- For each customer row in the outer query, the subquery counts how many orders that customer made.
- The subquery references c.customer_id, which changes with each row --- hence it runs multiple times.

### Comparison: Correlated vs. Non-Correlated Subqueries

| Feature       | Non-Correlated Subquery                         | Correlated Subquery                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dependency    | Independent of outer query                      | Depends on outer query values                              |
| Execution     | Runs once                                       | Runs for each row in outer query                           |
| Example       | WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) | SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.id      |
| Performance   | Faster on large datasets                        | Slower, especially on large tables                         |
| Use Case      | Global comparisons / filters                    | Row-wise logic (e.g. matching, ranking, per-row summaries) |
| Caching/Reuse | Result can be cached and reused                 | Recomputed for each outer row                              |
| Debugging     | Easy to run independently                       | Needs full outer query context to run                      |
| Placement     | SELECT, WHERE, FROM, JOIN                       | Typically in SELECT or WHERE                               |

### Best Practices for MySQL

- Use scalar subqueries in SELECT/WHERE only if returning 1 value.
- Alias all subqueries in FROM clause (MySQL requires it).
- Avoid deeply nested subqueries---refactor using CTEs or JOINs where possible.
- Profile queries using EXPLAIN to understand impact of subqueries.
- Use JOINs where possible for large datasets.
- Test correlated subqueries using EXPLAIN to detect inefficiencies.
