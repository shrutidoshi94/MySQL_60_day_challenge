## WHERE - Filtering

```sql
WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

```sql
WHERE department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000;
```

```sql
WHERE department IN ('IT', 'Marketing');
```

```sql
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;
```

```sql
WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';  -- starts with S
```

```sql
WHERE last_name LIKE '__S%';  -- 3rd letter is S
```

| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| `/` | Division | `a / b` |
| `%` | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` |

**Logical Operators**

Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AND` | True if both are true | `a = 1 AND b = 2` |
| `OR` | True if any is true | `a = 1 OR b = 2` |
| `NOT` | Reverses a condition | `NOT a = 1` |

**Bitwise Operators***

Used for bit-level operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | Bitwise AND | `a & b` |
| `\|`| Bitwise OR  | `a \| b`   |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR | `a ^ b` |
| `~` | Bitwise NOT | `~a` |
| `<<` | Left shift | `a << 1` |
| `>>` | Right shift | `a >> 1` |

**Assignment Operators**

Used to assign values (mostly in stored programs like procedures or variables).

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | Assign value | `SET @a = 5;` |
| `:=` | Assign value | `SELECT @a := 5;` |

### Match

**% - Matches Zero or More Characters**
```sql
--- Names that contain 'oh'
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%oh%';
```

**_ - Matches Exactly One Character**
```sql
--- Names with exactly 5 characters
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '_____';  -- 5 underscores
```


**Escape Wildcards When Needed**
<br>If your search includes actual % or _ characters (e.g., emails), use ESCAPE:</br>
```sql
--- Find emails containing a literal '%'
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE message LIKE '%!%%' ESCAPE '!';
```

**Full-Text Search (`MATCH` ... `AGAINST`)**

Full-Text Search (FTS) allows you to perform **searches** on large text data — much more advanced than using LIKE '%word%'.

```sql
-- 1. Create the table with a FULLTEXT index
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(8,2),
  FULLTEXT KEY ft_name_desc (name, description)
);

-- 2. Insert some sample products
INSERT INTO products (name, description, price)
VALUES
  ('Wireless Headphones', 'Over-ear, noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones with 30h battery life.', 199.99),
  ('Gaming Mouse',       'Ergonomic optical mouse with customizable RGB lighting.',        49.99),
  ('Laptop Stand',       'Adjustable aluminum stand for 13″–17″ laptops.',              29.99),
  ('Bluetooth Speaker',  'Portable speaker with deep bass and waterproof design.',      89.99);

-- 3. Find all products matching the search text "wireless bluetooth"
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description)
      AGAINST('wireless bluetooth' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

**How it Works**

1. **Full-Text Index** must exist on the columns you’re searching.
2. MySQL builds a **special index** of words (tokens) in the column.
3. MATCH ... AGAINST compares search terms against this index.
4. It returns **rows with a relevance score**, optionally ranked by it.

**Modes of Full-Text Search**

MySQL supports three modes:

**- Natural Language Mode (default)**

- Treats the search text like a natural sentence.
- Ranks rows by relevance.

```jsx
SELECT *, MATCH(description) 
        AGAINST('open source search engine') AS score
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(description) 
      AGAINST('open source search engine');
```

**Boolean Mode**

- Enables logical operators like +, -, *, ".

| **Operator** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| + | Word **must be present** |
| - | Word **must not be present** |
| * | Wildcard |
| " | Exact phrase |
| > / < | Increases or decreases relevance weight |

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, body)
      AGAINST('+mysql -oracle' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

**Query Expansion Mode**

- Useful when results are few.
- Adds **similar terms** from top results and reruns the query.

```sql
AGAINST('search terms' WITH QUERY EXPANSION)
```
