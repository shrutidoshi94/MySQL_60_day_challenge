# Data Query Language (DQL) - SELECT

A subset of SQL commands used specifically to retrieve data from one or more tables, producing a result set.

## SELECT list & Aliasing

Comma-separated sequence of one or more expressions you place immediately after the SELECT keyword.

**What you can put in the `SELECT` list**

- Simple column references. e.g. `user_id`, `created_at`
- Wildcard. e.g. `*` or `t.*`
- Literals. e.g. `42`, `'hello'`
- Arithmetic & other expressions. e.g. `price * quantity`, `IF(status='A','Active','Inactive')`
- Function calls
  - Scalar functions: `CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)`
  - Aggregate functions: `SUM(amount)`, `COUNT(*)`
  - Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (…)`, `AVG(salary) OVER (…)`
- Subqueries (scalar subqueries returning at most one value)
- Any combination of the above, with optional aliasing

```sql
SELECT
  e.id,                                                             -- column reference
  CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS full_name,              -- Scalar Function
  e.salary * 1.10                    AS increased_salary,           -- Arithmetic expression
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY e.department_id
    ORDER BY e.hire_date
  )                                   AS hire_seq_in_dept,          -- Windows Function
  (SELECT MAX(salary)
     FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
  )                                   AS max_dept_salary,           -- Subquery 
  '2025-06-09'                        AS report_date                -- Literal
FROM employees AS e
WHERE e.active = 1
ORDER BY increased_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
