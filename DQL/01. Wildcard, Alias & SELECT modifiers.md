## Wildcard *
Used to select all columns
`SELECT *`

## Alais AS

**Column Aliases**
```sql
SELECT 
	first_name AS name 
FROM employees;
```
```sql
SELECT 
	first_name name 
FROM employees;
```
**Table Aliases**
```sql
SELECT 
	e.first_name, 
	e.salary
FROM employees AS e;
```

**Alias in Subqueries / Derived Tables**

```sql
SELECT 
	dept, 
	avg_salary
FROM 
	(SELECT 
		department AS dept, 
		AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department) AS dept_summary;
 ```

## SELECT modifiers (must appear immediately after SELECT)  
- ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW
- HIGH_PRIORITY
- STRAIGHT_JOIN
- SQL_SMALL_RESULT | SQL_BIG_RESULT | SQL_BUFFER_RESULT
- SQL_NO_CACHE | SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS

Tweak how the server parses, optimizes, and executes a `SELECT` by adding **modifiers** immediately after the `SELECT` keyword. 

### ALL / DISTINCT / DISTINCTROW

**`ALL`**  
  - Default behavior: returns all matching rows, including duplicates.  
  - **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    SELECT ALL col1, col2, â€¦
    ```
    (the `ALL` keyword is implicit and almost never written).

**`DISTINCT`**  
  - Removes duplicate rows from the result set.  
  - **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2
      FROM my_table;
    ```
