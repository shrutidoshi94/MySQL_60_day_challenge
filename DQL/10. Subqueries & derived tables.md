## 10.	Subqueries & derived tables
Nest queries inside other queries (“subqueries”) and treat a subquery’s result as a virtual table (“derived table”). 

One can place subqueries in these contexts:
- **`WHERE` / `HAVING`**  
  Filter rows based on the subquery’s result.
- **`SELECT` list**  
  Return a computed value per row.
- **`FROM` clause** (see “Derived Tables” below).
- **`ON` clause** of a join.
- **`INSERT … SELECT`**, **`UPDATE … WHERE … (subquery)`**, etc.

### 10.1 Types of Subqueries

**10.1.1. Scalar subquery**
Returns exactly one value (one row, one column).
```sql
SELECT
	id,
	(
	SELECT MAX(score)
	FROM exams
	WHERE student_id = s.id
	) AS best_score
FROM students AS s;
```

**10.1.2. Row subquery**
Returns a single row with multiple columns.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE (customer_id, status) =
	(
	SELECT id, status
	FROM customers
	WHERE email = 'foo@example.com'
	);
```

**10.1.3. Table subquery**
Returns a full result set (multiple rows/columns). Commonly used with IN, EXISTS, or as a derived table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category_id IN
	(
	SELECT id
	FROM categories
	WHERE name LIKE 'Electro%'
	);
```

## 10.2 Correlated vs. Uncorrelated

**Uncorrelated**
Runs once, independent of the outer query.

```sql
SELECT user_id, name
FROM users
WHERE signup_date >
	(
	SELECT MAX(signup_date) - INTERVAL 30 DAY
	FROM users
	);
```

**Correlated**
References columns from the outer query; re-evaluated for each outer row.
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name
FROM users AS u
WHERE EXISTS
	(
	SELECT 1
	FROM orders AS o
	WHERE o.user_id = u.id
		AND o.created_at > '2025-01-01'
	);
```

Use EXISTS when you only need to test for the presence of matching rows.


## 10.3 Derived Tables (Subqueries in FROM)
A derived table is a subquery appearing in the FROM clause and treated as a temporary, anonymous table:
```sql
SELECT dt.region,
       SUM(dt.amount) AS total_sales
FROM (
	SELECT region, amount
	FROM transactions
	WHERE dt >= '2025-01-01'
	) AS dt
GROUP BY dt.region;
```

- AS dt alias is mandatory.
- You can join derived tables to other tables or other derived tables.
- Derived tables enable you to:
- 	Pre-filter or pre-aggregate data.
- 	Simplify complex joins and logic.
- 	Emulate CTEs (Common Table Expressions) in older MySQL versions.


**Derived table with `JOIN`**
```sql
SELECT c.name,
       dt.order_count
FROM customers AS c
	JOIN
	(
	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY customer_id
	)	AS dt
  ON c.id = dt.customer_id
WHERE dt.order_count > 5;
```

## 10.4. Performance & Optimization
	
**1. Materialization vs. Merging**
   - MySQL 8+ may merge simple derived tables into the outer query for better performance.
   - Complex derived tables are materialized into a temp table—be mindful of disk I/O.
**2. Indexes & Correlated Subqueries**
   - Ensure columns referenced in the subquery’s WHERE or JOIN are indexed to avoid full scans per row.
**3. Avoid SELECT * in Subqueries**
   - Only select needed columns to reduce data volume and improve speed.
**4. Replace Subqueries with Joins When Possible**
   - In many cases, an INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY can outperform subqueries, especially uncorrelated ones.


## 5. Limitations
- No ORDER BY in a subquery unless paired with LIMIT (and only if the outer context allows it).
- Cannot modify the same table in a subquery that you’re modifying in the outer statement (MySQL error 1093) without wrapping the subquery in a derived table.
- Derived tables cannot themselves be partitioned or indexed (aside from temp-table characteristics).

## 10.6 When to Use Which
| **Use Case**                       | **Subquery Style**        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Test for existence of related rows | EXISTS (correlated)       |
| Filter by a list of values         | IN (uncorrelated)         |
| Compute a single value per row     | Scalar subquery in SELECT |
| Pre-aggregate or pre-filter data   | Derived table in FROM     |
| Conditional logic in SELECT list   | CASE + subquery           |
