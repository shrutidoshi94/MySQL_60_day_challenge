# Windows Functions

A window function computes a value for each row based on a “window” of rows around it, without collapsing the result set into one row per group (as GROUP BY would). Window functions shine whenever you need to compute row-aware analytics without collapsing your result set.

You invoke one with an OVER (…) clause:

```sql
<window_func>(expression) OVER ( window_definition )
```

## Window Definition

A window definition tells MySQL which rows to include and in what order:

```sql
OVER (
   [ PARTITION BY partition_expr[, …] ]
   [ ORDER BY order_expr [ ASC | DESC ]]
   [ frame_clause ]
)
```

### PARTITION BY

Splits the rows into independent groups. If omitted, the window spans the entire result set.

### ORDER BY

Establishes a logical order within each partition. Required by rank-style and running aggregates.

### Frame clause (optional)

Further limits the set of rows relative to the current row:

```sql
-- General syntax
{ROWS | RANGE} BETWEEN <start_bound> AND <end_bound>

```

* **`ROWS` or `RANGE`** : This determines how the frame is defined.
  * **`ROWS`** : The frame is defined by a physical offset from the current row (e.g., "3 rows before," "1 row after"). This is generally more intuitive and commonly used.
  * **`RANGE`** : The frame is defined by a logical offset based on the value of the `ORDER BY` column(s). All rows that have a value within the specified range relative to the current row's `ORDER BY` value are included. This is more complex and less frequently used than `ROWS`, especially with non-numeric or single-column `ORDER BY` values. If `ORDER BY` contains multiple columns, `RANGE` only considers the *first* `ORDER BY` column for its logic.
* **`<start_bound>` and `<end_bound>`** : These define the beginning and end of the frame relative to the `CURRENT ROW`.
  Common boundary options:
  * **`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`** : The frame starts at the very first row of the partition.
  * **`<N> PRECEDING`** : The frame starts `N` rows before the `CURRENT ROW`.
  * **`CURRENT ROW`** : The frame starts or ends at the `CURRENT ROW` itself.
  * **`<N> FOLLOWING`** : The frame ends `N` rows after the `CURRENT ROW`.
  * **`UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`** : The frame ends at the very last row of the partition.

### Step-by-Step Examples: Aggregate Funtions

```sql
-- Basic Aggregations Over Entire Dataset
SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    SUM(amount) OVER () AS total_overall_sales,
    AVG(amount) OVER () AS avg_overall_sale,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_sales_transactions,
    MAX(amount) OVER () AS highest_overall_sale,
    MIN(amount) OVER () AS lowest_overall_sale
FROM
    sales;
```

**Explanation:**

The OVER () clause, with no PARTITION BY or ORDER BY, means the window function operates on all rows in the query result. Each row will display the same overall sum, average, count, max, and min.

```sql
-- Aggregations Partitioned by Region
SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS total_region_sales,
    AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS avg_region_sale,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS num_region_transactions, -- * counts NULL rows too
    MAX(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS highest_region_sale,
    MIN(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS lowest_region_sale
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date;
```

**Explanation:**
By adding `PARTITION BY region`, the window functions calculate the sum, average, count, max, and min *for each specific region* . So, all 'North' region rows will show the total sales for 'North', and all 'South' region rows will show the total sales for 'South', and so on.

```sql
-- Running Totals and Moving Averages (Ordered Window)

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS running_total_region_sales,
    AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_2_sales,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS running_count_region_sales
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date, product_id;

```

**Explanation:**

* **`running_total_region_sales`** : Calculates the cumulative sum of `amount` for each `region`, ordered by `sale_date` and `product_id`. For each row, it sums the current row's amount and all previous rows' amounts within that region.
* **`moving_avg_2_sales`** : This is a specific example of a *moving average* . For each row, it calculates the average of the current row's `amount` and the `amount` of the immediately preceding row within the same region, ordered by `sale_date` and `product_id`. The `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` explicitly defines this 2-row window frame.

```sql
-- Percentage of Total / Percentage Contribution

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS total_region_sales,
    (amount / SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region)) * 100 AS percent_of_region_total
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date;

```

**Explanation:**
We calculate `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region)` to get the total sales for the current row's region. Then, we simply divide the `amount` of the current row by this regional total to get the percentage contribution. This pattern is very common for relative analysis.

```sql
-- Identifying Sales Performance Against Average and Grouping by Performance Band

WITH RegionAverages AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        sale_date,
        amount,
        region,
        AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS avg_region_sale
    FROM
        sales
)

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    avg_region_sale,
    CASE
        WHEN amount > avg_region_sale THEN 'Above Regional Average'
        WHEN amount < avg_region_sale THEN 'Below Regional Average'
        ELSE 'At Regional Average'
    END AS sales_performance
FROM
    RegionAverages
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `RegionAverages`** :
   * First, we calculate `AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region)` to determine the average sale amount for each specific region. This average is attached to every row within that region.
2. **Outer Query** :
   * We then select all original columns plus the calculated `avg_region_sale` from our CTE.
   * A `CASE` statement is used to compare the individual `amount` of each sale with the `avg_region_sale` for its respective region. This allows us to categorize each transaction based on its performance relative to the regional average.

This last example demonstrates how window functions are often a building block for more sophisticated analytical queries, allowing you to perform calculations at different granularities and then use those results for further analysis or categorization.

### Step-by-Step Examples: Ranking Funtions

```sql
-- Basic Ranking Across the Entire Dataset

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS overall_row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS overall_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS overall_dense_rank
  
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    amount DESC, product_id; -- Added product_id for consistent ordering in ties
```

**Explanation:**

* **`OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC)`** : Defines the window as the entire result set, ordered by `amount` in descending order.
* **`ROW_NUMBER()`** : Assigns a unique sequential number to each row based on the overall amount, even if amounts are tied.
* **`RANK()`** : Assigns a rank based on amount. If amounts are tied, they get the same rank, and the next rank is skipped (e.g., if two rows are rank 1, the next unique rank is 3).
* **`DENSE_RANK()`** : Similar to `RANK()`, but if amounts are tied, they get the same rank, and the next rank is *not* skipped (e.g., if two rows are rank 1, the next unique rank is 2).

```sql
-- Ranking Within Partitions (By Region)

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_row_num,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_dense_rank
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, amount DESC, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC)`** : This is crucial. It tells MySQL to:
  * Divide the data into separate groups for each `region` (e.g., 'North', 'South').
  * Within each of these regional groups, order the sales by `amount` in descending order.
  * Apply the ranking functions independently to each regional group.
* This allows you to find the 1st, 2nd, etc., highest sales *within each region* .

```sql
-- Percentile Ranks and N-Tiles (Distribution Functions)

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount) AS region_cumulative_distribution,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount) AS region_percent_rank,
    NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_quartile -- Dividing into 4 groups
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, amount DESC, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`CUME_DIST()`** : For each row, it returns the cumulative distribution. It's the number of rows with a value less than or equal to the current row's value, divided by the total number of rows in the partition. Ranges from >0 to 1.
* **`PERCENT_RANK()`** : For each row, it returns its percentile rank. It's calculated as **(****r****ank****−****1****)****/****(****t****o****t****a****l****_****ro****w****s****−****1****)**. Ranges from 0 to 1.
* **`NTILE(4)`** : Divides the rows within each `region` into 4 approximately equal groups (quartiles) based on their `amount` (descending). Each row gets a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) indicating which quartile it belongs to.

```sql
-- Finding Top N Records Per Group

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    region_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        sale_date,
        amount,
        region,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_rank
    FROM
        sales
) AS ranked_sales
WHERE
    region_rank <= 2 -- Get the top 2 sales per region
ORDER BY
    region, region_rank;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Query (or CTE)** : First, we calculate the `RANK()` for each sale within its `region`, ordered by `amount` descending. This assigns `region_rank` to every sale.
2. **Outer Query** : We then select from this `ranked_sales` result and apply a `WHERE` clause (`region_rank <= 2`) to filter for only the top 2 sales (by amount) within each region. This demonstrates how to use the results of a window function for filtering.

```sql
-- Analyzing Sales Trends by Comparing Ranks Over Time

WITH DailyTopSales AS (
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        region,
        product_id,
        amount,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sale_date, region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS daily_region_rank
    FROM
        sales
),
Rank1Sales AS (
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        region,
        product_id,
        amount
    FROM
        DailyTopSales
    WHERE
        daily_region_rank = 1
)
SELECT
    region,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS unique_top_performing_products,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product_id ORDER BY product_id) AS top_product_ids
FROM
    Rank1Sales
GROUP BY
    region
ORDER BY
    region;
```



**Explanation:**

1. **`DailyTopSales` CTE** :
   * We partition by both `sale_date` and `region`, then order by `amount` descending.
   * `RANK()` is used to find the top sale(s) for *each day within each region* .
2. **`Rank1Sales` CTE** :
   * Filters the `DailyTopSales` to only include those sales that achieved `daily_region_rank = 1`. This effectively gives us the leading sale(s) for each date and region combination.
3. **Final Query** :
   * Groups the results by `region`.
   * Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT product_id)` to find out how many *unique products* managed to achieve the #1 sales rank on any given day within that region.
   * `GROUP_CONCAT` helps visualize which products these were.

This complex example demonstrates how ranking functions can be chained with other CTEs and aggregations to derive deeper business insights, such as identifying consistent top performers or product rotation in leadership positions.



### Step-by-Step Examples: Value Funtions

```sql
-- Example 1: Basic FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE within Partitions

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    FIRST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS first_sale_in_region,
    LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_sale_in_region
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`FIRST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id)`** : For each row, this returns the `amount` of the *first* sale within its `region` (ordered by `sale_date` then `product_id`). This value will be the same for all rows within a given region.
* **`LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)`** : This returns the `amount` of the *last* sale within its `region`. The crucial part here is `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. Without this explicit frame, the default frame (when `ORDER BY` is present) is `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, which would make `LAST_VALUE` return the `amount` of the current row, not the actual last row in the partition.

```sql
-- Comparing with Previous and Next Sales using LAG and LEAD

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    LAG(amount, 1, 0.00) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS previous_sale_amount,
    LEAD(amount, 1, 0.00) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS next_sale_amount,
    LAG(sale_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS previous_sale_date,
    LEAD(sale_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS next_sale_date
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`LAG(amount, 1, 0.00) OVER (...)`** : Retrieves the `amount` from the row 1 position *before* the current row within the same `region` (ordered by `sale_date`, `product_id`). If there's no preceding row (i.e., it's the first sale in the region), it returns `0.00` (the default value).
* **`LEAD(amount, 1, 0.00) OVER (...)`** : Retrieves the `amount` from the row 1 position *after* the current row within the same `region`. If there's no succeeding row (i.e., it's the last sale in the region), it returns `0.00`.
* The same logic applies to `LAG(sale_date, 1)` and `LEAD(sale_date, 1)` for retrieving dates.

```sql
-- Calculating Change (Difference) from Previous Period

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    LAG(amount, 1, amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS previous_sale_amount,
    amount - LAG(amount, 1, amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date, product_id) AS change_from_previous_sale
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* We use `LAG(amount, 1, amount)` where the `default_value` is set to `amount` itself. This ensures that for the very first sale in a region, `change_from_previous_sale` will be `amount - amount = 0`, making the calculation cleaner than if `NULL` or `0` were used for the first value.
* The `change_from_previous_sale` column directly shows how much the current sale `amount` has increased or decreased compared to the immediate previous sale in that region.

```sql
-- NTH_VALUE to Find Specific Sales (e.g., Second Highest)

SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    region,
    NTH_VALUE(amount, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS second_highest_sale_amount_in_region,
    NTH_VALUE(product_id, 3) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date ASC) AS third_oldest_product_id_in_region
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    region, amount DESC, product_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`NTH_VALUE(amount, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC)`** : Returns the `amount` of the 2nd row when sales are ordered by `amount` in descending order within each `region`. This effectively gives you the second-highest sale amount per region.
* **`NTH_VALUE(product_id, 3) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date ASC)`** : Returns the `product_id` of the 3rd row when sales are ordered by `sale_date` in ascending order within each `region`. This gives you the `product_id` of the third oldest sale.
* Note that if 'N' exceeds the number of rows in the partition, `NTH_VALUE` will return `NULL`.

**Explanation:**

* **`avg_last_3_sales`** : This calculates a simple 3-period moving average (current + 2 preceding) for sales within each region. The `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` frame defines this.
* **`avg_previous_2_sales`** : This is where it gets more specific. The frame `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING` tells the `AVG` function to only consider the two rows *immediately prior* to the current row. This explicitly excludes the current row from the average.
* **`diff_from_prev_2_avg`** : By subtracting the `avg_previous_2_sales` from the `amount` of the current row, we get a clear indication of whether the current sale performed better or worse than the average of the two sales that immediately preceded it in that region. This is a common pattern for identifying positive or negative trends.
