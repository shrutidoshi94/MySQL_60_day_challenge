## Windows Functions

A window function computes a value for each row based on a “window” of rows around it, without collapsing the result set into one row per group (as GROUP BY would). Window functions shine whenever you need to compute row-aware analytics without collapsing your result set.

You invoke one with an OVER (…) clause:

```sql
<window_func>(expression) OVER ( window_definition )
```

### Window Definition

A window definition tells MySQL which rows to include and in what order:

```sql
OVER (
   [ PARTITION BY partition_expr[, …] ]
   [ ORDER BY order_expr [ ASC | DESC ]  [, …] ]
   [ frame_clause ]
)
```

**1. PARTITION BY**

Splits the rows into independent groups. If omitted, the window spans the entire result set.

**2. ORDER BY**

Establishes a logical order within each partition. Required by rank-style and running aggregates.

**3. Frame clause (optional)**

Further limits the set of rows relative to the current row:

– **ROWS** frames count a fixed number of rows before/after the current row.

```sql
ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

– **RANGE** frames include all rows whose sort‐key values lie within a specified interval of the current row’s key.

```sql
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```



- **GROUPS** frame counts “peer groups” of equal sort‐key values rather than raw row offsets or value ranges.


**Named vs. Inline Windows**

- Inline: full spec inside each OVER (…).
- Named: declare once in a WINDOW clause and reuse:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  SUM(sales) OVER w  AS running_sales,
  AVG(sales) OVER w  AS avg_sales
FROM orders
WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY region
  ORDER BY order_date
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
);
```

### Step-by-Step Examples

**Simple Running Total**

```sql
SELECT
order_date,
total_amount,
SUM(total_amount) OVER (
ORDER BY order_date
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS running_total
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY order_date;
```

**Moving Average Over a 7-day Window**

```sql
SELECT
order_date,
total_amount,
AVG(total_amount) OVER (
ORDER BY order_date
ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS avg_last_7_days
FROM daily_sales;
```

**Ranking Salespeople by Region**

```sql
SELECT
region,
salesperson,
sales,
RANK() OVER (
PARTITION BY region
ORDER BY sales DESC
) AS regional_rank
FROM sales_data;
```

**Lead/Lag: Comparing to Previous Month**

```sql
SELECT
month,
revenue,
LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)       AS prev_month,
revenue - LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS month_diff
FROM monthly_revenue;
```

**NTILE: Quartiles of Scores**

```sql
SELECT
student_id,
score,
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS quartile
FROM exam_scores;
```

**FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE**

```sql
SELECT
dept,
employee,
salary,
FIRST_VALUE(employee) OVER w AS first_hired,
LAST_VALUE(employee)  OVER w AS last_hired
FROM employees
WINDOW w AS (
PARTITION BY dept
ORDER BY hire_date
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
);
```

5. Frame Types & Defaults
   1. Default frame
      •	If you specify ORDER BY but no explicit frame, MySQL uses:

RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

2. ROWS vs. RANGE
   •	ROWS: Physical offset (exact n rows before/after current).
   •	RANGE: Logical offset (values within a range of the ordering key).
3. GROUPS (MySQL 8.0.29+)
   •	Frames based on peer groups of equal ordering key.
4. Where & When to Use
   •	In SELECT to compute per-row aggregates, ranks, or offsets alongside row data.
   •	In ORDER BY or HAVING to sort or filter by window results (rare).
   •	Not allowed in WHERE (filters are applied before window functions).

Common use cases:
•	Running totals and cumulative metrics.
•	Period-over-period comparisons.
•	Top-N per group without SELF JOINs.
•	Moving averages and smoothing.
•	Percentile and distribution calculations.

7. Performance Tips
   •	Index your ORDER BY and PARTITION BY columns.
   •	Use bounded frames when possible instead of UNBOUNDED PRECEDING.
   •	Avoid overly large partitions unless necessary.
   •	Remember that window functions run after sorting and before final ORDER BY/LIMIT.
8. Putting It All Together: Complex Example

SELECT
visit_date,
country,
visits,
SUM(visits) OVER w       AS country_running_total,
AVG(visits) OVER (
PARTITION BY country
ORDER BY visit_date
ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS moving_avg_30d,
RANK() OVER w             AS daily_rank
FROM web_traffic
WINDOW w AS (
PARTITION BY country
ORDER BY visit_date
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
ORDER BY country, visit_date;

Recap
•	Window function = the computation (e.g. SUM(), RANK(), LAG()).
•	Window definition = the PARTITION BY, ORDER BY and frame specifications.
•	Use inline windows for one-off calculations; use named windows for DRY and clarity.
•	Combine multiple window functions over the same window to build rich, per-row analytics without joins or subqueries.
