## Windows Functions

A window function computes a value for each row based on a “window” of rows around it, without collapsing the result set into one row per group (as GROUP BY would). You invoke one with an OVER (…) clause:

```sql
<window_func>(expression) OVER ( window_definition )
```

### Window Definition

A window definition tells MySQL which rows to include and in what order:

```sql
OVER (
   [ PARTITION BY partition_expr[, …] ]
   [ ORDER BY order_expr [ ASC | DESC ]  [, …] ]
   [ frame_clause ]
)
```

**1. PARTITION BY**

Splits the rows into independent groups. If omitted, the window spans the entire result set.

**2. ORDER BY**

Establishes a logical order within each partition. Required by rank-style and running aggregates.

**3. Frame clause (optional)**

Further limits the set of rows relative to the current row:
- ROWS or RANGE (or GROUPS in MySQL 8.0.29+)
  
```sql
ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

```sql
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```


**Named vs. Inline Windows**
	•	Inline: full spec inside each OVER (…).
	•	Named: declare once in a WINDOW clause and reuse:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  SUM(sales) OVER w  AS running_sales,
  AVG(sales) OVER w  AS avg_sales
FROM orders
WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY region
  ORDER BY order_date
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
);
```

3. Common Built-in Window Functions

| **Category**                  | **Function**                                     | **Description**                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Ranking**                   | ROW_NUMBER()                                     | 1, 2, 3… within partition                 |
| RANK()                        | Gaps for ties (1, 2, 2, 4, …)                    |
| DENSE_RANK()                  | No gaps (1, 2, 2, 3, …)                          |
| **Offset**                    | LAG(expr, offset [, default])                    | Value from _n_ rows before                |
| LEAD(expr, offset[, default]) | Value from _n_ rows after                        |
| **Aggregate-style**           | SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()                       | Running totals, moving averages, etc.     |
| **Distribution**              | NTILE(n)                                         | Bucket rows into _n_ roughly equal groups |
| CUME_DIST()                   | Cumulative distribution (fraction ≤ current row) |
| PERCENT_RANK()                | (RANK−1)/(rows−1)                                |
| **Value-based**               | FIRST_VALUE(expr)                                | First value in window                     |
| LAST_VALUE(expr)              | Last value in window                             |
| NTH_VALUE(expr, n)            | _n_th value in window                            |

4. Step-by-Step Examples

4.1. Simple Running Total

SELECT
  order_date,
  total_amount,
  SUM(total_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY order_date;

4.2. Moving Average Over a 7-day Window

SELECT
  order_date,
  total_amount,
  AVG(total_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS avg_last_7_days
FROM daily_sales;

4.3. Ranking Salespeople by Region

SELECT
  region,
  salesperson,
  sales,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY region
    ORDER BY sales DESC
  ) AS regional_rank
FROM sales_data;

4.4. Lead/Lag: Comparing to Previous Month

SELECT
  month,
  revenue,
  LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)       AS prev_month,
  revenue - LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS month_diff
FROM monthly_revenue;

4.5. NTILE: Quartiles of Scores

SELECT
  student_id,
  score,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS quartile
FROM exam_scores;

4.6. FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE

SELECT
  dept,
  employee,
  salary,
  FIRST_VALUE(employee) OVER w AS first_hired,
  LAST_VALUE(employee)  OVER w AS last_hired
FROM employees
WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY dept
  ORDER BY hire_date
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
);

5. Frame Types & Defaults
	1.	Default frame
	•	If you specify ORDER BY but no explicit frame, MySQL uses:

RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW


	2.	ROWS vs. RANGE
	•	ROWS: Physical offset (exact n rows before/after current).
	•	RANGE: Logical offset (values within a range of the ordering key).
	3.	GROUPS (MySQL 8.0.29+)
	•	Frames based on peer groups of equal ordering key.

6. Where & When to Use
	•	In SELECT to compute per-row aggregates, ranks, or offsets alongside row data.
	•	In ORDER BY or HAVING to sort or filter by window results (rare).
	•	Not allowed in WHERE (filters are applied before window functions).

Common use cases:
	•	Running totals and cumulative metrics.
	•	Period-over-period comparisons.
	•	Top-N per group without SELF JOINs.
	•	Moving averages and smoothing.
	•	Percentile and distribution calculations.

7. Performance Tips
	•	Index your ORDER BY and PARTITION BY columns.
	•	Use bounded frames when possible instead of UNBOUNDED PRECEDING.
	•	Avoid overly large partitions unless necessary.
	•	Remember that window functions run after sorting and before final ORDER BY/LIMIT.

8. Putting It All Together: Complex Example

SELECT
  visit_date,
  country,
  visits,
  SUM(visits) OVER w       AS country_running_total,
  AVG(visits) OVER (
    PARTITION BY country
    ORDER BY visit_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS moving_avg_30d,
  RANK() OVER w             AS daily_rank
FROM web_traffic
WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY country
  ORDER BY visit_date
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
ORDER BY country, visit_date;

Recap
	•	Window function = the computation (e.g. SUM(), RANK(), LAG()).
	•	Window definition = the PARTITION BY, ORDER BY and frame specifications.
	•	Use inline windows for one-off calculations; use named windows for DRY and clarity.
	•	Combine multiple window functions over the same window to build rich, per-row analytics without joins or subqueries.
