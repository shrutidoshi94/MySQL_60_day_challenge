| **CROSS JOIN**       | Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.                                                                                                        | `SELECT columns FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **SELF JOIN**        | Joins the table with itself. Useful when you need to compare rows within the same table.                                                                                                                                                      | `SELECT columns FROM table1 t1 INNER JOIN table1 t2 ON t1.column = t2.column;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **JOIN Using UNION** | Combines results of two or more`SELECT` queries into a single result set. Each query must have the same number of columns and compatible data types. `UNION` eliminates duplicates (use `UNION ALL` to include all records, even duplicates). | `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;`<br><br>or<br><br>`SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;`                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Key Differences and MySQL Specifics

### Key Differences and MySQL Specifics:

* **`ANTI JOIN`:** MySQL doesn't have a specific `ANTI JOIN` keyword. As you correctly identified in your original table, you achieve this functionality by using a `LEFT JOIN` (or `RIGHT JOIN`) and then filtering for `NULL` values in the joined table's column. This means "anti-joins" are really just specialized `LEFT` or `RIGHT` joins with a `WHERE` clause.
* **`FULL JOIN` and `FULL ANTI JOIN`:** MySQL does not natively support the `FULL JOIN` keyword. To replicate its behavior, you need to combine a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN` using `UNION ALL`. The `WHERE` clause in the `RIGHT JOIN` part `WHERE table1.column IS NULL` is crucial to avoid duplicating the records that *do* have matches. The `FULL ANTI JOIN` similarly requires combining the `LEFT ANTI JOIN` and `RIGHT ANTI JOIN` logic.

The rest of the `JOIN` types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS, SELF, and UNION for combining queries) work exactly as described in your original table with standard SQL syntax, which MySQL supports
